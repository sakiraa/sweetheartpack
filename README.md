# Snom sweetheart pack!

An in-development, cute, soft and simple resource pack!
This resource pack requires optifine to work for custom entities. 

The version will be updated after each official Optifine launch. Currently at 1.14.4 F5.

~ Cats are now snoms. Each breed of cat is turned into a different snom variant. This includes: normal, albine, punk, naked/peeled, rainbow, froggy chair, pyukumuku and pincurchin.

~ Parrots are now frosmoths. There's a 1 in 5 chance you see a shiny one!

~ Foxes are now furrets, and arctic ones are shiny!

Known issues: 
- I am aware that the on shoulder parrot/frosmoth model is broken. This is a Minecraft issue and can't be solved as of today.
- Yes, the snom collars look like a handle. I am still learning how to fix this
- Animations are funky. Learning optifine CEM animations is complicated, but I'll upload updates about it!

Please re-check this page often! I've just started this project and there'll be a lot of optimization and new content on a very short amount of time, so keep the pack updated for better models, textures and functions.
You're free to remove the entities, textures and models you don't want off my pack. This will not alter the behaviour of anything else if done correctly.
